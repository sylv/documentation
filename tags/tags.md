# Tags

Tags are essentially placeholders with extra steps. They can range from being just that, simple placeholders, to complicated statements. While the main use for tags are in [Actions](../plugins/actions.md), they are not limited to them. Anywhere the [Tag Editor](tag-editor.md) shows up, most tags will work.   


Tag names are not case-sensitive, so `{message.authorId}` is the same as `{message.authorid}` as far as the bot is concerned.
