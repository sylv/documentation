description: Help keep Atlas around

# Premium

Atlas is a free bot, and the core features will always be free. But everything comes with a price, and hosting Atlas isn't free, nor is the countless hours I've poured into it over the 3 years it's been around. Premium helps keep Atlas around, and makes it possible to provide a better user experience to everyone.

If you want Atlas to stay around, you can get Premium \(or Supporter if you have some spare change\) and get some perks cool perks in the process. Atlas is entirely funded by these few tiers, so if you enjoy the bot you should consider it. That said, don't feel pressured to donate.

You can choose a tier on Patreon at [https://www.patreon.com/join/NotSylver](https://www.patreon.com/join/NotSylver)
