# Introduction

Atlas is a simple bot for your Discord server that aims to make your life as a user, moderator or owner easier. It can do a lot of things that are standard with bots in this class - welcome messages, auto-moderation, music, and more. Additionally, it can do some pretty incredible things with simple `{tags} and Actions.`

This documentation will help you through the initial setup, and cover more advanced topics like [Tags](tags/tags.md). If you haven't used Atlas before, you'll likely want to check out the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page first.
