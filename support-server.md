# Support Server

Atlas has an official support server and support staff to help you get started. If you ever get stuck, we're always here to help. Please keep in mind that you are not entitled to support. We're all volunteers, coming in thinking you're an alpha and making demands will get you kicked. 

Make sure to follow the rules and use the appropriate channel. The \#actions channel should be used for help with actions or tags. \#support 1 is for asking general questions, and \#support 2 is overflow if \#support 1 is busy.

You can join by going to [https://atlasbot.xyz/support](https://atlasbot.xyz/support).
