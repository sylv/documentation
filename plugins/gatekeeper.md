# Gatekeeper

The Gatekeeper module lets you send messages when users join or leave your server. All messages support tags.

* **Direct-message new members** Send new users a welcome message in their direct-messages. Use this with care, as some new members won't enjoy getting a message upon joining and others may have direct-messages disabled entirely, in which case the bot will silently fail. 
* **Join message** Just a simple way to welcome new members by sending a message to a channel. 
* **Leave message** Join messages but the opposite
