# Levels

The levels plugin lets users gain roles by sending messages. When they send a message, they get a random amount of experience between 3.5 and 12.5. There is a 1-minute cooldown between earning experience, so spamming the same message won't help you. 

You can use the level calculator to get rough information on how long a level takes to achieve [https://atlasbot.xyz/level-calculator](https://atlasbot.xyz/level-calculator). Keep in mind that leveling is slow - level 50 would take years to reach for the average member.

Each server gets their own leaderboard for levels, which you can access by doing `a!leaderboard` and following the link it provides.

Members in a voice channel do not gain experience.

Adding a channel to the blacklist will stop the plugins commands from being used and will prevent users in that channel from gaining experience. Adding a role will prevent users in the role from earning experience and using the plugins commands.

The notification option controls whether to notify users on level-up. Tags are supported. 

If the "Stack Rewards" option is enabled, roles for previous levels will remain when a user levels up. Otherwise, Atlas will remove previous rewards once they get a new level reward.
